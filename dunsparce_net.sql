Grass-types, while useful against Kyogre, have a significant disadvantage due to Kyogre\'s access to Blizzard. Know what moveset you\'re facing before you rush in with a Grass team. Regardless, let\'s talk Fury Cutter: Fury Cutter is such a beast of a Bug-type move that, when paired with Frenzy Plant, its TTFA (Time to Full Activation) is just 3.4 seconds! Compare this with Venusaur\'s considerably slower 5.4 seconds.

That said, Roserade resists Kyogre\'s electric and water attacks, making it a viable counter in these scenarios. Roserade\'s Razor Leaf is nowhere near as efficient as Vine Whip or Fury Cutter charging up a Frenzy Plant though. It\'s TTFA is around 8 seconds, so keep this in mind as you enter a raid battle with it.',5),(112,'Exeggutor (Alolan)','https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/7/74/103Exeggutor-Alola.png',103,'Kygore','Bullet Seed','Grass','Solar Beam','Grass','Alolan Exeggutor has one of the weaker Grass movesets, however, its stats make up for its lack of powerful moves.

It stands to reason that Rayquaza would make this list. Rayquaza also takes reduced damage from Fighting-type moves.<br/><br/>Other potential Flying-type candidates include Sky Attack Moltres, Honchkrow, and Lugia. However, due to Machamp\'s access to Rock Slide, it is not recommended that you go with any Flying-type counters, even Rayquaza. Only choose Flying-attackers if you know for sure Machamp does not have Rock Slide!',4),(312,'Garchomp','https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/fa/445Garchomp.png',445,'Raikou','Mud Shot','Ground','Earthquake','Ground','Garchomp is the pseudo-legendary version of Groudon.

It also helps that Garchomp doubly-resists Raikou’s <span class=‘Electric>Electric</span>-type attacks with it’s dual <span class=‘Dragon’>Dragon</span>/<span class =‘Ground’>Ground</span> typing.

Slightly lower in every base state category (except stamina), and does not have access to the best Ground-type moveset. Mud-Slap is not as energy efficient and doesn\'t charge up Earthquake as fast as Mud Shot. However, Rhyperior and Groudon have the same faint count, so go with Rhyperior if you don\'t have enough Groudon to fill a team.',3),(342,'Mamoswine','https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/d/d0/473Mamoswine.png/1200px-473Mamoswine.png',473,'Raikou','Mud-Slap','Ground','Bulldoze','Ground','Mamoswine is renowned for its versatility as an Ice-type attacker, however, it does serve a purpose as a budget Ground-type attacker.

Since its addition, Palkia actually now outperforms Kyogre as the best Water-type legendary, at least against Groudon. Thanks to its unique Dragon/Water typing, Palkia doubly resists Fire Blast and takes neutral damage from Solar Beam. Watch out for Groudon\'s Dragon Tail though, as Palkia still takes SE damage from it.',2),(392,'Mewtwo','https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/7/78/150Mewtwo.png',150,'Groudon','Psycho Cut','Psychic','Ice Beam','Ice','Mewtwo is the prime, versatile generalist. It can tank Groudon\'s moves in any weather situation and deals SE damage with Ice Beam.

Not only does it have all around higher stats, but it also has access to Counter, one of the best Fighting type fast moves.

Nonetheless, Heatran sports two devastating moves against Shiftry. However, despite having significantly higher stats than its rivaling Bug-type counters, Heatran lacks an optimal moveset, and only gets STAB on its Charged attack. As a result, Heatran has a very high TTW, and should only be used when TTW is not a concern.',4),(632,'Moltres','https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/1/1b/146Moltres.png',146,'Shiftry','Fire Spin','Fire','Sky Attack','Flying','Moltres, despite packing the best Flying-type move AND being a beastly Fire-type attacker, takes a back seat to the Shiftry raids. This is primarily because other counters are able to take advantage of Shiftry\'s double weakness to Bug.

It primarily hints about some huge new features - in this post, we\'ll cover Shadow and Purified Pokemon!<br/><br/><h2>New Features Found in APK</h2><br/><ul><li><strong>Shadow Pokemon:</strong> a new form of PokÃ©mon that have their own stats, move values, candy and Stardust multipliers.</li><br/><li><strong>Purification:</strong> A mechanic that converts Shadow Pokemon into their normal versions, requires stardust and candy to perform.</li><br/><li><strong>Alignments:</strong> Either Shadow or Purified.</li></ul><br/<br/><h2>Everything Known About Shadow Pokemon</h2><br/>Presently, the following Pokemon are listed as having Shadow forms: Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmader, Charmeleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise, Ratatta, Raticate, Zubat, Golbat, Crobat, Dratini, Dragonair, Dragonite, Snorlax, Mudkip, Marshtomp, Swampert.<br/><br/>Shadow Pokemon have a new attribute called \"Alignment\", which is similar to Gender and Form. Pokemon are either Shadow or Purified, and there is a badge associated with number of purified Pokemon. In order to Purify a Shadow Pokemon, you must spend a certain amount of Stardust and Candy.<br/><br/>Shadow and Purified Forms are handled similar to other Pokemon Forms, like Deoxys. This means they have their own sets of stats and moves. The possibilities for this are endless! We could see a complete shake-up to the Raid and PVP meta with the introduction of Shadow Pokemon who have different base stats and moves (if Shadow Pokemon are even usable outside of their designated feature). We could also see some events down the line that encourage Purifying various Pokemon for some rare rewards (like Sinnoh Stones, Rare Candies, TMs, Raid Passes, and more!), or difficult Raid Battles involving Shadowed Legendaries (curiously, the APK makes no mention of the most famous Shadow Pokemon, Lugia...).<br/></br>One last thing to note - Every Pokemon in the list from the APK is involved from Gen 1 / Kanto EXCEPT for the Mudkip line (and Crobat obviously, but Crobat evolves from Golbat so it makes sense why Crobat is listed). It is quite possible that we get a surprise event or teaser during the Mudkip Community Day this July.

We have yet to understand why these PokÃ©mon in particular are suddenly appearing more frequently. Perhaps they have some special significance wherever Team GO Rocket came from?\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>Features</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shiny Ekans, Koffing, Sneasel, and Zubat are now available in the wild and in raids!</li>\r\n<li>The following Pokemon will hatch more frequently from Eggs: Rattata, Ekans, Sandshrew, Zubat, Meowth, Machop, Magnemite, Grimer, Gastly, Drowzee, Cubone, Koffing, Murkrow, Sneasel, Houndour, and Poochyena.</li>\r\n<li>Raids will feature Pokemon that are significant to Team GO Rocket.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nWe hope these are the last of the disruptions weâ€™ll see from Team GO Rocket... In the meantime, Trainers, keep exploring the world around you, and let us know what you discover.','https://pokemongolive.com/img/posts/teamgorocketdisruption2019.jpg','https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/teamgorocketdisruption2019/','2019-08-01 16:00:00','2019-07-25 16:00:00');
